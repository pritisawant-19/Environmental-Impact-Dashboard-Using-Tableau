# Environmental Impact Dashboard

## Overview

The **Environmental Impact Dashboard** is an interactive tool designed to monitor and analyze environmental metrics across different regions and industries. It helps organizations and stakeholders visualize key sustainability indicators, including carbon emissions, water consumption, energy usage, and recycling rates. The dashboard enables data-driven decisions to improve environmental performance and sustainability practices.
